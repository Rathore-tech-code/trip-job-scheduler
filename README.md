# Distributed Trip Job Scheduler

A Java 21, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL backend for scheduling one-off and recurring jobs across three worker nodes. It supports tenant time zones, sharded work assignment, fenced leases, retries, tenant concurrency limits, and an idempotent database effect ledger.

**This repository has an HTTP API, not a web UI.** The steps below use `curl`. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture, failure handling, guarantees, and trade-offs.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose (`docker compose version`)
- A Bash shell, `curl`, and Python 3 for the copyable example commands
- Ports **8080**, **8081**, **8082**, and **5432** available on your machine

You do not need to install Java, Maven, or PostgreSQL for the Docker setup. Run all commands from the project directory.

## Start the project

```bash
read -rsp 'Choose an admin password: ' ADMIN_PASSWORD; echo
export ADMIN_PASSWORD
APP_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$ADMIN_PASSWORD" docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

The first build downloads the Java and PostgreSQL images and Maven dependencies, so it can take a few minutes. When ready, the health request returns `{"status":"UP"}`. Node 1 serves the examples at `http://localhost:8080`; nodes 2 and 3 serve the same API on ports 8081 and 8082. All three share one PostgreSQL database.

The first startup creates the HTTP Basic user `admin` with `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The password is stored as a BCrypt hash. **Changing the environment variable later does not change the password of an existing admin account.** Keep the password out of screenshots. Use HTTPS in front of the API before exposing it outside your machine.

## Try the API

The following commands create a tenant, schedule a recurring job, trigger it immediately, and inspect its run. Keep `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the startup step in the same shell.

### 1. Create a tenant

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8080
TENANT=$(curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Demo client","zone":"Asia/Kolkata","concurrencyCap":8}' \
  "$BASE/api/admin/tenants" |
  python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')
echo "$TENANT"
```

`zone` is an IANA time zone. `concurrencyCap` limits how many runs this tenant can execute at once (1 to 128).

### 2. Create a recurring job

```bash
JOB=$(curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"kind":"CRON","cron":"0 0 22 * * *","payload":"roster-generation","priority":1,"maxRunSeconds":60,"misfire":"COALESCE"}' \
  "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/jobs" |
  python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')
echo "$JOB"
curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/jobs/$JOB/next?count=5"
```

The six-field cron expression above schedules 10:00 PM every day in the tenant's time zone. `misfire` can be `FIRE_NOW`, `SKIP`, or `COALESCE`. A one-off job uses `"kind":"ONE_OFF"` and an ISO-8601 timestamp such as `"at":"2030-01-01T16:30:00Z"` instead of `cron`.

### 3. Trigger and inspect a run

```bash
RUN=$(curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" -X POST \
  "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/jobs/$JOB/trigger" |
  python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["runId"])')
echo "$RUN"
curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/runs/$RUN"
curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/runs/$RUN/effects"
```

The run state moves from `READY` to `RUNNING` to `SUCCEEDED`; the last request then returns `{"count":1}`. If it is still processing, wait a second and repeat the two `GET` requests.

**The effect is a row in PostgreSQL's `effect` table.** This demo does not send real cab alerts or call another provider. A real provider must deduplicate the run's idempotency key to preserve the exactly-once effect guarantee outside this database.

## Other useful requests

The examples below use the `BASE` and `TENANT` values created above.

| Action | Request |
| --- | --- |
| Pause a tenant | `curl -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" -X POST "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/pause"` |
| Resume a tenant | `curl -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" -X POST "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/resume"` |
| List dead-letter runs | `curl -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/dead"` |
| Replay a dead-letter run | `curl -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" -X POST "$BASE/api/tenants/$TENANT/dead/RUN_ID/replay"` |
| Health check | `curl "$BASE/actuator/health"` |
| Prometheus metrics | `curl -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" "$BASE/actuator/prometheus"` |

To create a tenant-scoped operator or employee, an admin can call `POST /api/admin/users`:

```bash
curl -fsS -u "admin:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"username\":\"demo-operator\",\"password\":\"replace-with-12-plus-characters\",\"role\":\"OPERATOR\",\"tenantId\":\"$TENANT\"}" \
  "$BASE/api/admin/users"
```

`ADMIN` can manage all tenants. `OPERATOR` can manage jobs and dead letters for its tenant. `EMPLOYEE` can read its tenant's next fire times and run status. Cross-tenant requests return 404.

## Tests and benchmark

Run the unit and PostgreSQL integration tests with:

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```

The script starts a separate test database on port **55432** and runs Maven in a Docker container. The suite covers daylight-saving transitions, shard redistribution, concurrent claims, stale fencing tokens, tenant limits, retries, dead-letter replay, and tenant isolation. The last verified run had **7 passing tests**.

With the application running, you can measure a scheduler-only burst:

```bash
APP_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$ADMIN_PASSWORD" bash scripts/benchmark.sh 1000
```

This benchmark inserts ready runs directly into PostgreSQL, so it excludes API creation time. On one development machine (Intel Core i5-12450HX, 12 logical CPUs, 23 GiB RAM, PostgreSQL 16.13, Java 21, one worker node), 1,000 simultaneous runs completed at **120.2 runs/s**, with **7.051 s p50** and **9.286 s p99** fire lag. The case study's p99 under 2 seconds target was **not met** for that burst. The 100,000-run, three-node target has not been verified.

## Stop and troubleshoot

```bash
docker compose logs -f node1
docker compose stop
```

`docker compose stop` preserves the containers and their database contents for the next `docker compose start`. **`docker compose down` removes the PostgreSQL container and its data**, because this demo does not configure a persistent volume.

If startup fails, check `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs postgres node1`. Port conflicts are common; free ports 5432 and 8080-8082 before retrying. If authentication fails after changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, remember that an existing database still has the password from its first startup.
